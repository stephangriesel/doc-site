The main reason for starting this documentation site is so I can go back and review what I have done in the past. As humans we are pretty good at remembering things but it is really hard to remember every bit of information and I find it good to document it for myself to make it easier to understand.

In my first post I am going to run through how to set up basic Gastby site. This is my preferred method and hope you like it too :)

## Assumptions & Tips:

- Your environment is set up already, not going to go into details. Tip: Install Gatsby globally.
- Gatsbyjs.org's documentation is really good, [check it out:](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/quick-start/)

### 1. Install Gatsby with a starter

You can see all the starters in [their starters library](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/), for this example I am going to use the [Hello World Starter](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-hello-world/), which is the bare minimum. Setting it up this way I also understand what I am using and what I am using it for.

### 2. GraphiQL is great but GraphQL Playground is better
