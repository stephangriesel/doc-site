The main reason for starting this documentation site is so I can go back and review what I have done in the past. As humans we are pretty good at remembering things but it is really hard to remember every bit of information and I find it good to document it for myself to make it easier to understand.

In my first post I am going to run through how to set up basic Gastby site. This is my preferred method and hope you like it too :)

## Assumptions & Tips:

- Your environment is set up already, not going to go into details. Tip: Install Gatsby globally.
- Gatsbyjs.org's documentation is really good, [check it out:](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/quick-start/)

### 1. Install Gatsby with a starter

You can see all the starters in [their starters library](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/), for this example I am going to use the [Hello World Starter](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-hello-world/), which is the bare minimum. Setting it up this way I also understand what I am using and what I am using it for.

### 2. GraphiQL is great but GraphQL Playground is better

I prefer to use GraphQL Playground by Prisma. Main reason is because I can save my queries in different tabs and go back to older query if needed.
[More info & download here](https://github.com/prisma-labs/graphql-playground)

### 3. CSS Modules for styling

CSS Modules are just cleaner way to manage styling on my site. This is my go to method for styling. See the [Gatsby Docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/css-modules/) on how to use this.

### 4. Site metadata

Set up site metadata and reference with query. Your config should look something like this

```
gatsby-config.js
================

module.exports = {
  siteMetadata: {
    title: `Gatsby`,
    siteUrl: `https://www.gatsbyjs.org`,
    description: `Blazing fast modern site generator for React`,
  },
}
```

More on the config API can be see on [Gatsby Docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-config/)

### 5. Query

```
{
  site {
    siteMetadata {
      title
      siteUrl
      description
    }
  }
}
```

Render data:

#### StaticQuery

```
import React from "react"
import { useStaticQuery, graphql } from "gatsby"

const ComponentName = () => {
  const data = useStaticQuery(graphql`
    {
      site {
        siteMetadata {
          title
          siteUrl
          description
        }
      }
    }
  `)
  return (
      <div>
        <p>{data.site.siteMetaData.title}</p>
        <p>{data.site.siteMetaData.description}</p>
      </div>
  )
}

export default ComponentName

```
